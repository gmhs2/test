* Administrators
* Landlords
* Students  

####1.2	Purpose
The purpose of the user guide is to assist the user in setting up and using the Flatfinder application.

####1.3	How to use this document

* Chapter 3 contains tutorials for the three user types: Students, Landlords and Administrators  


####1.4	Problem reporting
Since the Flatfinder developing team will be dissolved after completion of the CO2015 project, the issue of

###2. Overview

The application is implemented with a web-based approach. The web application will allow users from 
different location to use it and search for desired properties using location based search engine. The 
software allows different users to work together and create a platform for students and landlords to 
perform leasing. Moreover, students are able to use the buddy up function to find relevant/suitable 
peers to rent together and ultimately creating a better environment for students’ accommodation renting.
